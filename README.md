## Setting Up WordPress

Install and activate the following WordPress plugins:

- [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
- [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://github.com/wp-premium/advanced-custom-fields-pro)
- [WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf)

Once WordPress is running, you'll be able to compose queries from the admin area using [the GraphQL query composer](http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=graphiql-ide).
